[Veronica K. B. Olsen][1] successfully defended her PhD dissertation at UiO today. The dissertation, with the title [_Beam Loading in a Proton Driven Plasma Wakefield Accelerator_][2], is based on her research at CERN where she has processed large amounts of simulation data using Fortran. The analysis was done in Matlab and she wrote two large libraries [OsirisAnalysis][4] and [QuickPICAnalysis][5] to do this analysis. The libraries are on GitHub and are being used by other students as well.

Dr. Olsen currently works as a Research Fellow at CERN on the [High Luminosity LHC][3], which is an upgrade to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). As a part of this work she is currently working on [SixTrack][6] which is _"a single particle 6D symplectic tracking code optimized for long term tracking in high energy rings"_. Which is used, among other things, to simulate the LHC. SixTrack is also written in Fortran, which is a language that is used a lot in scientific computing.

I made a feeble attempt to live-tweet the dissertation, having no physics background to speak of.
